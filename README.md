Portfolio.html:

I chose materialize css for the usage with components like "cards" and "center- aligned" text. 

 Getting the pictures sized properly and with text proved to be tenuous to say the least. The re sizing of the images onto the page and making sure certain links were input on my file just kept alluding me.

 Line: 1-15: Basic set up and links to css sites etc.

 Line 16-30: Background picture and some styling.

 Line 38-48: Input Nav bar with a class of "transparent" and placed social media icons.

 Line 50-54: I placed a section withing the header for a "Welcome to my page" text.

 Line 56-114: I placed a row with three cards.

 Line 111-122: I placed the script sources for font awesome, jquery, materialize.
